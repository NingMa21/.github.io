This course provides an overview of Human-Centered Design (HCD) â€” a framework for problem-solving and innovation through iterative design process that can be utilized across diverse problem domains. The HCD framework emphasizes involving human perspectives in every step of the design iteration. This can result in highly efficient and usable products, services, and systems. In this course, we will explore and engage with design processes, methodologies, and tools relevant to the HCD framework. We will specifically focus on understanding and developing a set of skill sets through readings and class activities. The final project will provide an opportunity for students to put these skills into practice. Overall, the course will help students to develop a base of useful theoretical knowledge and practical skills regarding the HCD framework.
