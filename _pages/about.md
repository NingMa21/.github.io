I am a postdoc research fellow in the Department of Computer Science in the University of British Columbia, where I work as a mentor and researcher in the Design Lab and the Designing for People network. I hold a Ph.D. in Information Sciences and Technology from the Pennsylvania State University and a B.A. in Mathematics from Concordia University Wisconsin. 

My research fits under the Human-Computer Interaction (CHI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). I study and theorize the practice and experiences of workers in gig platforms. I am passionate about using novel ways to understand the barriers workers face and their stakes on these platforms so that I can design and evaluate interactive technologies to inform an equitable workplace that empowers workersâ€™ agency through exploration of their varied contexts and marginalized identities. Informed by labor, management, and feminist theories, my research aims to contribute to the design discussions of diversity and equity in gig workplaces.
